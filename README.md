### Reflection
<p>
    I-Farm is a company that focuses on indoor farming in urban areas, providing for local communities to consume fresh, pesticide-free vegetables. It uses the power of technology to
make it easier for residents in urban areas who wish to practice a healthy lifestyle but are unable to purchase fresh food from outside. By providing delivery service, people do not have
to step out of their house to buy groceries, and it can save them time and energy.

  I am truly impressed by the technological advancements employed by I-Farm. They inspire me to contribute to the development of systems that promote a healthier and more convenient lifestyle. 
  Dr. Seah has also mentioned the importance of doing a competitor analysis while building a system in order to improve ourselves and stand out among all of our competitors. 
  I have learned a lot from this talk, and I am grateful that I was given a chance to learn from Dr. Seah's past experience.
